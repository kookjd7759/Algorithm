### 문제 설명

<p>After years of planning, you're finally ready to host the Tic-Tac-Toe world championships. Everything had been going great until you made a terrible discovery: the judges, who determine which player has won the game, have been taking bribes! There's not enough time to train new ones, so you opt for a backup plan: you'll create a piece of code that analyzes the board and tells the players if anyone has won.</p>

<p>A Tic-Tac-Toe board looks like the following. Every square can be empty, filled with an <code>X</code>, or filled with a <code>O</code> (capital letter 'o').</p>

<p> Player <code>X</code> has won if they have three <code>X</code>'s in a row. Player <code>O</code> wins if they can do the same with the <code>O</code>'s. A row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.</p>

<p>Can you write the new judging code and salvage the competition?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of three lines each with <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="CHTML" style="font-size: 109%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c33"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>3</mn></math></mjx-assistive-mml><span aria-hidden="true" class="no-mathjax mjx-copytext">$3$</span></mjx-container> characters. Each line represents a row on the board. Each character in a line represents a column. This means you have <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="CHTML" style="font-size: 109%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c33"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>3</mn></math></mjx-assistive-mml><span aria-hidden="true" class="no-mathjax mjx-copytext">$3$</span></mjx-container> rows and <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="CHTML" style="font-size: 109%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c33"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>3</mn></math></mjx-assistive-mml><span aria-hidden="true" class="no-mathjax mjx-copytext">$3$</span></mjx-container> columns just like a normal Tic-Tac-Toe board.</p>

<p>Each square in the board contains either an <code>X</code>, <code>O</code> (that's a capital letter, not a number), or E. <code>X</code> and <code>O</code> represent markings made by the players while E represents an empty square.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>If player <code>X</code> has won, you should print out the character <code>X</code>. If player <code>O</code> has won, you should print out the character <code>O</code>. If neither player has won, you should print out the character N.</p>
