### 문제 설명

<p>Rock-Paper-Scissors is game for two players, A and B, who each choose, independently of the other, one of <em>rock, paper,</em> or <em>scissors</em>. A player chosing <em>paper</em> wins over a player chosing <em>rock</em>; a player chosing <em>scissors</em> wins over a player chosing <em>paper</em>; a player chosing <em>rock</em> wins over a player chosing <em>scissors</em>. A player chosing the same thing as the other player neither wins nor loses.</p>

<p>A tournament has been organized in which each of <em>n</em> players plays <em>k</em> rock-scissors-paper games with each of the other players - <em>k*n*(n-1)/2</em> games in total. Your job is to compute the <em>win average</em> for each player, defined as <em>w / (w + l)</em> where <em>w</em> is the number of games won, and <em>l</em> is the number of games lost, by the player.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Input consists of several test cases. The first line of input for each case contains <em>1 ≤ n ≤ 100</em> <em>1 ≤ k ≤ 100</em> as defined above. For each game, a line follows containing p<sub>1</sub>, m<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, m<sub>2</sub>. 1 ≤ p<sub>1</sub> ≤ <em>n</em> and 1 ≤ p<sub>2</sub> ≤ <em>n</em> are distinct integers identifying two players; m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> are their respective moves ("rock", "scissors", or "paper"). A line containing 0 follows the last test case.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output one line each for player 1, player 2, and so on, through player <em>n</em>, giving the player's win average rounded to three decimal places. If the win average is undefined, output "-". Output an empty line between cases.</p>
